:orange:`Introducing NEST 3.0`
------------------------------

NEST 3.0 provides a more intuitive experience with simplified yet versatile handling and manipulation of nodes and connections.


- Visit our :doc:`What's new? <guides/nest2_to_nest3/nest2_to_nest3_overview>` guide to get an overview of NEST 3.0 and the new functionality.


- Read the :doc:`Detailed transition guide <guides/nest2_to_nest3/nest2_to_nest3_detailed_transition_guide>` for an in-depth comparison between old and new syntax.

NEST is a simulator for **spiking neural network models**, ideal for networks of any size, for example:

1.  Models of information processing e.g., in the visual or auditory cortex of
    mammals,

2.  Models of network activity dynamics, e.g., laminar cortical networks or
    balanced random networks,

3.  Models of learning and plasticity.
