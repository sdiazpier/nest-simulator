    Connect `pre` nodes to `post` nodes.

    Nodes in `pre` and `post` are connected using the specified connectivity
    (`all-to-all` by default) and synapse type (:cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::StaticConnection>` by default).
    Details depend on the connectivity rule.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Specifies synapse model, see below
    return_synapsecollection: bool
        Specifies whether or not we should return a :py:class:`.SynapseCollection` of pre and post connections

    Raises
    ------
    kernel.NESTError

    Notes
    -----
    It is possible to connect NumPy arrays of node IDs one-to-one by passing the arrays as `pre` and `post`,
    with no connection specification, and a synapse specification, `syn_spec`, with at least the synapse model.
    You may also specify weight, delay, and receptor type for each connection as NumPy arrays in the `syn_spec`
    dictionary.

    If pre and post have spatial posistions, a `mask` can be specified as a dictionary. The mask define which
    nodes are considered as potential targets for each source node. Connections with spatial nodes can also
    use `nest.spatial_distributions` as parameters, for instance for the probability `p`.

    **Connectivity specification (conn_spec)**

    Available rules and associated parameters::

     - 'all_to_all' (default)
     - 'one_to_one'
     - 'fixed_indegree', 'indegree'
     - 'fixed_outdegree', 'outdegree'
     - 'fixed_total_number', 'N'
     - 'pairwise_bernoulli', 'p'
     - 'symmetric_pairwise_bernoulli', 'p'

    See :ref:`conn_rules` for more details, including example usage.

    **Synapse specification (syn_spec)**

    The synapse model and its properties can be given either as a string
    identifying a specific synapse model (default: :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::StaticConnection>`) or
    as a dictionary specifying the synapse model and its parameters.

    Available keys in the synapse specification dictionary are::

     - 'synapse_model'
     - 'weight'
     - 'delay'
     - 'receptor_type'
     - any parameters specific to the selected synapse model.

    See :ref:`synapse_spec` for details, including example usage.

    All parameters are optional and if not specified, the default values
    of the synapse model will be used. The key 'synapse_model' identifies the
    synapse model, this can be one of NEST's built-in synapse models
    or a user-defined model created via :py:func:`.CopyModel`.

    If `synapse_model` is not specified the default model :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::StaticConnection>`
    will be used.

    Distributed parameters can be defined through NEST's different parametertypes. NEST has various
    random parameters, spatial parameters and distributions (only accesseable for nodes with spatial positions),
    logical expressions and mathematical expressions, which can be used to define node and connection parameters.

    To see all available parameters, see documentation defined in distributions, logic, math,
    random and spatial modules.

    **syn_spec**

    The synapse model and its properties can be inserted either as a
    string describing one synapse model (synapse models are listed in the
    synapsedict) or as a dictionary as described below.

    Note that only the synapse type is checked when we disconnect and that if
    `syn_spec` is given as a non-empty dictionary, the 'synapse_model' parameter must be
    present.

    If no synapse model is specified the default model :cpp:class:`static_synapse <nest::StaticConnection>`

    ::

    - 'synapse_model'
    - 'weight'
    - 'delay',
    - 'receptor_type'
    - parameters specific to the synapse model chosen

    'synapse_model' determines the synapse type, taken from pre-defined synapse
